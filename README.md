<code>Software Engineer and Web Developer</code>

## 🐢 Welcome to My Code Oasis! 🚀

Hey there! I'm Seweryn, a passionate programmer with a penchant for all things eccentric and a deep love for web development. If you're wondering why turtles are mentioned in the same breath as code, well, I'll let you in on a little secret - turtles are my spirit animal 🐢❤️! Just like these shelled creatures, I take life at my own pace, methodically navigating through the vast digital oceans of code.

Here's what you can expect to find in my GitHub garden:

🌐 **Web Wizardry:** I specialize in crafting captivating web experiences. From front-end magic with React and Next to the server-side wonders of Node.js and Python, I'm always weaving spells to make the web a more enchanting place.

🚀 **Eccentric Endeavors:** Expect the unexpected! My code ventures often take unusual turns, as I embrace the eccentricity that fuels my creativity. No box, no comfort zone - just endless exploration.

🐢 **Turtle Admirer:** If you haven't noticed yet, I am obsessed with turtles. They're the embodiment of patience, resilience, and serenity - qualities that I value a lot. Besides, they just look adorable, and that's always a plus.
